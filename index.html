      <p>
     I believe the magic of cultural understanding has the ability to transcend differences between people and solve world problems. The propensity for literature, art, philosophy, and music to reach beyond limited personal experience in order to touch our common humanity is essential to our species' function and growth. This connection must continue to be explored. By studying digital humanities, I am attempting to take advantage of modern digital tools that will help me express my interest in spreading cultural connections throughout the world. I intend to focus on establishing cultural awareness within an educatonal context, and am looking forward to IIT providing the skills for me to do so.

      Currently I am involved in research for faculty at the school, and I hope to eventually use that as a launching point for much of my future research on programming learning tools. As I continue to learn more about what digital humanities major has the capability to teach me, I expect my interests and goals to fluctuate over time. However, my ultimate goal will always be the same: to bring culture to those without access, and to establish community connections in an increasingly globalized world.
